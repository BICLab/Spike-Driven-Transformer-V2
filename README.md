## Abstract

Neuromorphic computing, which exploits Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic chips, is a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional AI. CNN-based SNNs are the current mainstream of neuromorphic computing. By contrast, no neuromorphic chips are designed especially for Transformer-based SNNs, which have just emerged, and their performance is only on par with CNN-based SNNs, offering no distinct advantage. In this work, we propose a general Transformer-based SNN architecture, termed as "Meta-SpikeFormer", whose goals are: (1) **Lower-power**, supports the spike-driven paradigm that there is only sparse addition in the network; (2) **Versatility**, handles various vision tasks; (3) **High-performance**, shows overwhelming performance advantages over CNN-based SNNs; (4) **Meta-architecture**, provides inspiration for future next-generation Transformer-based neuromorphic chip designs. Specifically, we extend the [Spike-driven Transformer](https://github.com/BICLab/Spike-Driven-Transformer) into a meta architecture, and explore the impact of structure, spike-driven self-attention, and skip connection on its performance. On ImageNet-1K, Meta-SpikeFormer achieves **80.0% top-1 accuracy** (55M), surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN baselines (66M) by 3.7%. This is the first direct training SNN backbone that can simultaneously **supports classification, detection, and segmentation**, obtaining SOTA results in SNNs. Finally, we discuss the inspiration of the meta SNN architecture for neuromorphic chip design.
